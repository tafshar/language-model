l@@ et us re@@ member , mr. speaker , that these se@@ g@@ ments of our soci@@ e@@ ty form the b@@ ac@@ k@@ b@@ one of our e@@ conom@@ y .  
he@@ ar , he@@ ar !  
he@@ ar , he@@ ar !  
mr. speaker , my question is direc@@ ted to the minister of trans@@ port .  
bo@@ th have many years ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture and dis@@ tribu@@ tion of fo@@ res@@ t pro@@ duc@@ ts .  
1 .  
an@@ other point i should like to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s is the right of the sup@@ p@@ li@@ er to cho@@ ose his cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers as he se@@ es f@@ it .  
i am ge@@ t@@ ting si@@ c@@ k and ti@@ red of minis@@ ter@@ s who se@@ e@@ m to have some h@@ an@@ g - up with re@@ g@@ ard to the coll@@ ecti@@ ve b@@ arg@@ ain@@ ing proc@@ ess .  
there is jus@@ t one sp@@ ec@@ i@@ fi@@ c it@@ e@@ m more that i would like to com@@ ment u@@ p@@ on and th@@ en i will si@@ t do@@ wn , mr. speaker .  
order , ple@@ ase .  
3 .  
i can ref@@ er hi@@ m to no bet@@ ter au@@ th@@ or@@ ity on the sub@@ j@@ ect than the hon. member for d@@ on val@@ le@@ y , not jus@@ t m@@ y@@ sel@@ f .  
it is qu@@ ite un@@ der@@ stand@@ able .  
in ad@@ di@@ tion , it could be@@ come a ser@@ i@@ ous th@@ re@@ at to con@@ feder@@ ation and national un@@ ity .  
in vi@@ e@@ w of this , we de@@ em@@ ed it in@@ ad@@ vis@@ able to at@@ ten@@ d the me@@ e@@ ting and so inform@@ ed co@@ j@@ o .  
mr. speaker , the minister su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ted that a gre@@ at@@ er bu@@ il@@ ding progr@@ am mi@@ ght le@@ ad to in@@ f@@ l@@ ation@@ ary pres@@ sure .  
i dis@@ agre@@ e with the ar@@ gu@@ ment ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed by the minister .  
there is a lo@@ t to be said on bo@@ th sid@@ es of that question .  
order .  
mr. speaker , as i in@@ dic@@ ated to the leader of the opposition , i would h@@ op@@ e to make an ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ement on this question on no@@ v@@ emb@@ er 1 .  
qu@@ ite right .  
it does not br@@ ing an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy c@@ lo@@ s@@ er to re@@ h@@ abili@@ t@@ ation to is@@ ol@@ ate hi@@ m from the public .  
he le@@ f@@ t a wi@@ f@@ e and fam@@ il@@ y .  
on a point of order , mr. ch@@ ai@@ r@@ man , i am sure the hon. member for ver@@ d@@ un would not have d@@ en@@ i@@ gr@@ ated my position .  
can the in@@ sur@@ ance indus@@ try in tu@@ r@@ n act as an ai@@ r@@ l@@ ine ?  
i say this to you , mr. speaker : the people of tor@@ on@@ to know the government has no ans@@ w@@ ers .  
their e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence on the st@@ ate of e@@ ac@@ h st@@ oc@@ k was tak@@ en fu@@ l@@ ly into ac@@ coun@@ t .  
th@@ an@@ k you very m@@ u@@ ch , mr. speaker , and i th@@ an@@ k hon. members for al@@ low@@ ing me the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge to contin@@ ue .  
i ur@@ ge this in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve st@@ u@@ dy , mr. speaker , for we know so li@@ t@@ t@@ le about the re@@ as@@ ons that tu@@ r@@ n people into crimin@@ als .  
the government must ass@@ is@@ t its o@@ wn emplo@@ ye@@ es who m@@ ay ne@@ ed an@@ other l@@ an@@ gu@@ age to ad@@ v@@ ance their ca@@ re@@ ers .  
i do not have any qu@@ al@@ m@@ s about the t@@ y@@ pe of l@@ an@@ gu@@ age i u@@ se .  
motion agre@@ ed to .  
mr. speaker , no dec@@ ision has been re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed as y@@ et but i should think so .  
the mat@@ ter of tr@@ a@@ de rel@@ ations with our eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an coun@@ ter@@ par@@ ts should be very ser@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly con@@ sid@@ er@@ ed .  
what we should be concern@@ ed with in this country is the situation when these an@@ im@@ als are shi@@ p@@ p@@ ed out of canada for this pu@@ r@@ pose .  
they have al@@ re@@ ad@@ y gi@@ ven an in@@ dic@@ ation of the br@@ an@@ ch@@ es they in@@ ten@@ d to c@@ lo@@ se .  
this minister w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed wh@@ i@@ le h@@ al@@ f the pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds and pro@@ f@@ its of the canadian agricul@@ ture indus@@ try were s@@ we@@ p@@ t a@@ way in a budget spe@@ ec@@ h .  
mr. ch@@ ai@@ r@@ man , ab@@ solu@@ t@@ ely n@@ one .  
we are an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ing the re@@ port now and i h@@ op@@ e to have some inform@@ ation for the house in the ne@@ ar fu@@ ture .  
he@@ ar , he@@ ar !  
he@@ ar , he@@ ar !  
i would th@@ er@@ e@@ fore mo@@ ve , se@@ con@@ ded by the hon. member for d@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ ou@@ th - h@@ ali@@ fa@@ x e@@ ast ( mr. for@@ re@@ st@@ all ) :  
when we re@@ ali@@ z@@ e the ex@@ t@@ ent of the r@@ av@@ ag@@ es c@@ aus@@ ed by organ@@ i@@ z@@ ed cri@@ me in our country , we must con@@ sid@@ er de@@ e@@ p - ro@@ o@@ ted solu@@ tions .  
but o@@ h how their po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar@@ ity so@@ a@@ red and they co@@ as@@ ted thr@@ ough on that .  
( 2 ) a committee is b@@ oun@@ d by , and not at lib@@ er@@ ty to de@@ part from , the order of ref@@ er@@ ence .  
there is one other point i should like to make , and i do so as i fe@@ el this is a gen@@ eral debate .  
in dec@@ emb@@ er there was an ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ement that b@@ ri@@ tis@@ h col@@ um@@ bi@@ a would be with@@ dr@@ a@@ w@@ ing from c@@ em@@ a .  
they have also gi@@ ven r@@ ise to con@@ sid@@ er@@ able opposition by hon. members in all parti@@ es on this si@@ de of the house .  
those are not the l@@ in@@ es that one should be concern@@ ed about at this time .  
i have al@@ low@@ ed the hon. member tw@@ o sup@@ pl@@ ement@@ ari@@ es and in fai@@ r@@ n@@ ess i think we should g@@ o to some other hon. members .  
i think that is go@@ od .  
i think that the time tak@@ en in h@@ and@@ l@@ ing r@@ ou@@ ti@@ ne app@@ lic@@ ations for chang@@ es of f@@ ac@@ ili@@ ties al@@ ong a pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine , for exam@@ p@@ le , has been to@@ o l@@ ong .  
he is the minister who is respon@@ si@@ ble for s@@ ci@@ ence and te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ g@@ y , and he does not know .  
federal government car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers get $ 6@@ .@@ 4@@ 2 in tor@@ on@@ to and $ 5@@ .@@ 2@@ 3 in h@@ ali@@ fa@@ x and mon@@ c@@ ton .  
for the re@@ cor@@ d i would like to ref@@ er to a pres@@ s re@@ le@@ ase which f@@ ol@@ low@@ ed the federal - provin@@ cial con@@ fer@@ ence of at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys gen@@ eral in oc@@ to@@ ber , 19@@ 7@@ 5 .  
mr. speaker , i r@@ ise on a point of order .  
i think the r@@ ail@@ ro@@ ad ter@@ m is « dem@@ and lo@@ ad@@ ing » .  
i will come to the co@@ st of bo@@ ats these d@@ ays .  
in mo@@ st provinces , gen@@ eral no@@ ise re@@ gu@@ l@@ ations have been im@@ pl@@ ement@@ ed , the m@@ ain prin@@ cip@@ le of which is as f@@ ol@@ low@@ s :  
agre@@ ed .  
af@@ ter all , en@@ er@@ g@@ y is us@@ ed by people thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the n@@ ation , and the government mi@@ ght w@@ ell con@@ sid@@ er an appro@@ ac@@ h us@@ ing the in@@ c@@ enti@@ ve to which i have ref@@ er@@ red .  
6 .  
i will be g@@ l@@ ad , when we have time , to si@@ t do@@ wn with hon. members and work this mat@@ ter out on a pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ ve and pro@@ sp@@ ecti@@ ve b@@ as@@ is .  
will the minister take ac@@ tion to c@@ le@@ ar up any di@@ ffi@@ cul@@ ties because of the ab@@ solu@@ te ne@@ ed for pl@@ ac@@ ing the ord@@ ers now , and not some mon@@ th@@ s from now ?  
it will s@@ pu@@ r the cons@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of new fis@@ h@@ ing bo@@ ats and c@@ ause new proc@@ ess@@ ing f@@ ac@@ ili@@ ties to be bu@@ il@@ t .  
there are many th@@ ings i could say about bill c - 1@@ 9 .  
i am go@@ ing to say som@@ e@@ thing a b@@ it l@@ at@@ er on about that because i think it is es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al to the k@@ in@@ d of debate we are h@@ av@@ ing this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .  
comp@@ an@@ ies fin@@ d that the r@@ u@@ les are comp@@ lic@@ ated , cu@@ m@@ ber@@ some and chang@@ ing all the time .  
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister in char@@ ge of the canadian wh@@ e@@ at bo@@ ard .  
i un@@ der@@ st@@ and that a r@@ ate of at le@@ ast 7@@ 0 p@@ er c@@ ent p@@ er ann@@ um is being cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ated .  
it is our h@@ op@@ e to make a dec@@ ision this we@@ e@@ k .  
we ac@@ cep@@ t y@@ our vi@@ e@@ w .  
they f@@ ou@@ ght an el@@ ection on that position .  
1@@ 2 .  
mr. speaker , i say to that : what a cr@@ u@@ el ho@@ a@@ x , because a ho@@ a@@ x it is .  
mr. speaker , we will try to s@@ tic@@ k to that su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ tion .  
1 . ( a ) $ 9@@ 8@@ ,@@ 3@@ 5@@ 5 . ( b ) they are dis@@ tribu@@ ted thr@@ ough ma@@ j@@ or pos@@ t offi@@ ces ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the country .  
cri@@ me is a national pro@@ b@@ le@@ m accor@@ ding to our constitu@@ tion , wh@@ i@@ le la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement is a provin@@ cial and lo@@ c@@ al respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ty .  
i sub@@ m@@ it that what i say is per@@ tin@@ ent to the bill , to mon@@ e@@ ys being sp@@ ent on me@@ dic@@ are and the man@@ n@@ er in which they are sp@@ ent .  
a fe@@ w wor@@ ds about this dis@@ e@@ ase mi@@ ght h@@ el@@ p to pu@@ t th@@ ings into per@@ sp@@ ecti@@ ve .  
for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely they are fe@@ w@@ er this year , more re@@ as@@ on@@ able and respon@@ si@@ ble , more con@@ ci@@ li@@ at@@ or@@ y .  
this bill has been before the house for more than a year .  
re@@ ti@@ red dec@@ emb@@ er 3@@ 0 , 19@@ 7@@ 5 f@@ ol@@ low@@ ing com@@ ple@@ tion of 3@@ 4 years of public servi@@ ce .  
pass@@ age of the hon. member '@@ s motion would me@@ an that the cont@@ ent re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments are sp@@ ell@@ ed out in the stat@@ u@@ te and we could debate them .  
this does not n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y in@@ dic@@ ate non - comp@@ li@@ ance on the part of the parti@@ es .  
i was not as@@ king for a de@@ t@@ ail@@ ed ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation as to what he was do@@ ing .  
how can so m@@ u@@ ch be as@@ k@@ ed , on the one h@@ and , and so li@@ t@@ t@@ le ans@@ w@@ er@@ ed on the other ?  
as a re@@ sul@@ t , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s he will br@@ ing in diff@@ er@@ ent legislation which will not l@@ ay hi@@ m op@@ en to the char@@ ge of c@@ en@@ s@@ or@@ shi@@ p .  
e@@ i@@ ther they do their jo@@ b pro@@ per@@ ly , or you must get the po@@ w@@ er so that you can be sure that they do it pro@@ per@@ ly .  
in our national cap@@ it@@ al we have all the str@@ ain@@ s and all the di@@ ver@@ gen@@ ci@@ es of our country .  
hon. joh@@ n n . tu@@ r@@ n@@ er ( minister of fin@@ ance ) mo@@ ved :  
as m@@ u@@ ch as i h@@ ate to ad@@ m@@ it it , there has been go@@ od legislation br@@ ou@@ ght in by lib@@ eral govern@@ ments in this country -@@ -  
as the member for the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our@@ ing ri@@ ding i am w@@ ell a@@ w@@ are of his pers@@ is@@ ten@@ ce and h@@ ard work .  
where is the ai@@ b ?  
at the m@@ om@@ ent , that f@@ act , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , is se@@ en in tw@@ o - th@@ ir@@ ds of the country not as an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity , but as a b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er to op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .  
do not for@@ ce a mor@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ um do@@ wn our th@@ ro@@ ats .  
this not the first time that members of parliam@@ ent are go@@ ing to he@@ ar that .  
the sa@@ me re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation was made in the re@@ port of the stand@@ ing committee on priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ es and el@@ ec@@ tions on a@@ pr@@ il 2@@ 9 of l@@ ast year .  
mr. speaker , i am a@@ fr@@ aid the hon. member is ill inform@@ ed .  
in the mo@@ t ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent re@@ port it is st@@ ated :  
mr. speaker , the federal off@@ er was for a $ 100 milli@@ on progr@@ am .  
in mo@@ st s@@ am@@ p@@ les of this si@@ z@@ e -@@ - that is , a grou@@ p of over 5@@ 00 -@@ - this would be c@@ all@@ ed ne@@ g@@ li@@ gi@@ ble .  
the tr@@ adi@@ ti@@ onal pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re for se@@ e@@ king new b@@ or@@ ro@@ w@@ ing po@@ w@@ ers is to at@@ t@@ ac@@ h a cl@@ ause to sup@@ pl@@ y b@@ ill@@ s br@@ ou@@ ght before the house .  
this s@@ tri@@ k@@ es at the ro@@ o@@ ts of dem@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , and it is the right of the people to know .  
this would re@@ lie@@ ve the pres@@ sure on o@@ il .  
the sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al inves@@ ti@@ g@@ ation di@@ v@@ ision has not been in ex@@ is@@ ten@@ ce s@@ in@@ ce ear@@ ly 19@@ 7@@ 5 .  
mo@@ re@@ over , this is not a mat@@ ter of sa@@ ying wh@@ e@@ ther we are for or ag@@ ain@@ st some s@@ or@@ t of ass@@ is@@ t@@ ance for adop@@ ti@@ ve par@@ ents .  
l@@ et us se@@ e the do@@ cu@@ ments .  
canada has contin@@ u@@ ed to gi@@ ve its support to the n@@ a@@ to al@@ li@@ ance as an ab@@ solu@@ t@@ ely in@@ dis@@ pen@@ s@@ able de@@ ter@@ r@@ ent and an ab@@ solu@@ t@@ ely in@@ dis@@ pen@@ s@@ able as@@ sur@@ ance of our sec@@ ur@@ ity .  
can you be@@ lie@@ ve su@@ ch a b@@ an in 19@@ 7@@ 8 ?  
no , mr. ch@@ ai@@ r@@ man .  
n@@ at@@ ur@@ ally , the government at@@ temp@@ ts to get the b@@ est possi@@ ble de@@ al for the canadian public in any ser@@ ies of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .  
i would ad@@ d , mr. speaker , that it must be contin@@ u@@ ed .  
if i want any st@@ ati@@ s@@ tic@@ s as to where this country stand@@ s , certain@@ ly i will not ref@@ er to the spe@@ ec@@ h made by the prime minister .  
we lo@@ o@@ k@@ ed at all the imp@@ lic@@ ations of that .  
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s it would be a go@@ od i@@ de@@ a for me to quo@@ te a ti@@ m@@ min@@ s ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er because ma@@ y@@ be it rel@@ at@@ es to the hon. member .  
mr. speaker , in@@ de@@ ed i have the fin@@ al re@@ port from the pr@@ ai@@ ri@@ e r@@ ail ac@@ tion committee .  
( i@@ i ) ( a ) th@@ re@@ e v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ les will be us@@ ed by si@@ x canadian ex@@ per@@ ts rel@@ ated to the prov@@ ision of te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ al ass@@ is@@ t@@ ance .  
19@@ 7@@ 9 .  
and we will im@@ pl@@ ement e@@ very re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation in the au@@ d@@ it@@ or gen@@ eral '@@ s re@@ port , som@@ e@@ thing which we have been c@@ all@@ ing for over the l@@ ast t@@ en years .  
first , mr. speaker , i should like to make a fe@@ w gen@@ eral re@@ mar@@ ks .  
mr. ch@@ ai@@ r@@ man , i will se@@ e if there is su@@ ch a fi@@ gu@@ re av@@ ail@@ able , but i would qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with the wor@@ ds of the hon. member .  
i know he would not want to di@@ ver@@ t me from respon@@ ding to a very ser@@ i@@ ous question by his col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue .  
contin@@ u@@ ally we get the m@@ ess@@ age from ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the way that this progr@@ am will co@@ st the government som@@ e@@ thing .  
that is the cro@@ w@@ d which did not like the 1@@ 8 c@@ ents .  
what is at issue h@@ ere is the prin@@ cip@@ le that the public of canada has a right to know about the constitu@@ tion of canada .  
they want to p@@ ic@@ k and cho@@ ose what they will support .  
do you have it in w@@ ri@@ ting ?  
i re@@ ali@@ z@@ e , mr. ch@@ ai@@ r@@ man , that there is no m@@ ag@@ i@@ c solu@@ tion .  
in 19@@ 7@@ 8 am@@ er@@ i@@ can@@ s di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 2@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 ti@@ mes .  
the very re@@ sul@@ t of un@@ employ@@ ment b@@ re@@ ak@@ s up fam@@ ili@@ es , and contribu@@ tes to ex@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ve al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and dr@@ u@@ g u@@ se .  
the offi@@ cial opposition was tr@@ ying to des@@ tro@@ y pe@@ tr@@ o - canada in the sh@@ or@@ t si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s it was in offi@@ ce .  
in@@ ste@@ ad of c@@ aus@@ ing an inter@@ n@@ al s@@ ch@@ is@@ m ,  
and now they are ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ding th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves for vo@@ ting ag@@ ain@@ st sec@@ ur@@ ity of sup@@ pl@@ y .  
as to m@@ ak@@ ing contribu@@ tions , i am re@@ min@@ ded of a st@@ or@@ y .  
m@@ ad@@ am speaker , i would like to he@@ ar from the hon. member before i mo@@ ve my motion .  
the pre@@ vi@@ ous speaker also m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed they would like to have the provinces inv@@ ol@@ ved in pre@@ par@@ ations for any me@@ e@@ tin@@ g@@ s .  
my f@@ ri@@ end from tor@@ on@@ to sa@@ ys 5@@ 3 more years .  
all of those es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es in@@ dic@@ ate that canada will be in m@@ u@@ ch more tr@@ ou@@ ble as a re@@ sul@@ t of the national en@@ er@@ g@@ y progr@@ am than we were in before .  
mr. prime minister :  
in@@ de@@ ed , there will be more di@@ v@@ isi@@ ven@@ ess than posi@@ ti@@ ve eff@@ ec@@ ts .  
wor@@ l@@ d - wi@@ de in@@ f@@ l@@ ation is c@@ aus@@ ing a se@@ ver@@ e form of e@@ conom@@ i@@ c dis@@ lo@@ c@@ ation .  
the p@@ t@@ 7 re@@ pres@@ ents the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a new fam@@ il@@ y of eng@@ in@@ es in a po@@ w@@ er r@@ ang@@ e ab@@ o@@ ve that of the hi@@ gh@@ ly su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ fu@@ l p@@ t@@ 6 eng@@ ine .  
mr. speaker , i w@@ el@@ come the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to jo@@ in in this ad@@ jour@@ n@@ ment debate -@@ -  
the com@@ peti@@ tion poli@@ cy is as v@@ it@@ al to an indus@@ tri@@ al str@@ at@@ e@@ g@@ y as the over - all pl@@ an or the sp@@ ec@@ i@@ fi@@ c s@@ et of pl@@ ans which should be dev@@ elop@@ ed .  
we are now t@@ al@@ king about $ 4@@ 5 b@@ illi@@ on to cons@@ tr@@ uc@@ t the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine .  
these f@@ la@@ w@@ s are all ref@@ l@@ ec@@ ted in this bill .  
at this st@@ age of the debate of the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , there are th@@ re@@ e sp@@ ec@@ i@@ fi@@ c amend@@ ments which my party propos@@ es to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce .  
the government can@@ not cl@@ ai@@ m that there is any chang@@ e in the b@@ al@@ ance of w@@ ays and me@@ ans .  
a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al prov@@ ision of federal ass@@ is@@ t@@ ance for re@@ gi@@ onal dev@@ elop@@ ment com@@ es un@@ der this progr@@ am , ri@@ d@@ a , and sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary un@@ its .  
what did the government do ?  
he said that if we u@@ se un@@ employ@@ ment as the solu@@ tion to in@@ f@@ l@@ ation , we will get re@@ co@@ very .  
con@@ serv@@ ation is be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to have its eff@@ ect .  
there could be a ste@@ el m@@ ill in b@@ ri@@ tis@@ h col@@ um@@ bi@@ a , for exam@@ p@@ le .  
order , ple@@ ase .  
that is why pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als should not be ch@@ arg@@ ed for their work in pro@@ g@@ res@@ s .  
i be@@ lie@@ ve , mr. speaker , that what is h@@ ap@@ pen@@ ing today is a go@@ od thing but it is jus@@ t the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , the people of canada are respon@@ si@@ ble for m@@ ak@@ ing those pa@@ y@@ ments .  
we are now f@@ ac@@ ed with legislation that is des@@ ign@@ ed to with@@ dr@@ a@@ w from program@@ s that were in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed at a time when we could af@@ for@@ d them .  
that is why we had to im@@ port 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 s@@ k@@ ill@@ ed wor@@ k@@ ers into this country at a time when un@@ employ@@ ment was ris@@ ing .  
as car@@ ter said b@@ ack in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s , « a bu@@ c@@ k is a bu@@ c@@ k is a bu@@ c@@ k » and should be tax@@ ed as su@@ ch .  
order , ple@@ ase .  
all of this me@@ ans a to@@ t@@ al cu@@ t over the n@@ ex@@ t tw@@ o years of $ 2@@ ,@@ 9@@ 5@@ 8 , or 1@@ 5 p@@ er c@@ ent of the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al $ 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 s@@ al@@ ary .  
we he@@ ard in the ne@@ w@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing that the he@@ at@@ h - ste@@ e@@ le min@@ e in nor@@ th@@ er@@ n new br@@ un@@ s@@ w@@ ic@@ k is being c@@ lo@@ s@@ ed do@@ wn .  
they are re@@ ad@@ y to f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w our lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p .  
we have a n@@ um@@ ber of those k@@ in@@ ds of program@@ s and dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions go@@ ing on at the pres@@ ent m@@ om@@ ent .  
out of that m@@ om@@ ent@@ um of i@@ de@@ as and acti@@ v@@ ity , we have to as@@ k our@@ sel@@ ves , why has the dev@@ elop@@ ment pro@@ b@@ le@@ m not been sol@@ ved ?  
i would like to end on a posi@@ ti@@ ve no@@ te , mr. speaker .  
i want to make it pl@@ ain , mr. speaker , that the federal government does not s@@ et re@@ t@@ ail pri@@ ces .  
the house m@@ et at 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ .  
i re@@ min@@ d hon. members that the minister in resp@@ ect of trans@@ mis@@ sion l@@ in@@ es ref@@ er@@ red to the sa@@ me po@@ w@@ er that now ex@@ is@@ t .  
that is tr@@ u@@ ly a l@@ au@@ d@@ able go@@ al with which we all agre@@ e .  
m@@ ad@@ am speaker , i have a sup@@ pl@@ ement@@ ary question for the minister of trans@@ port .  
l@@ et me come now to pe@@ tr@@ o - canada .  
this will re@@ sul@@ t in tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous s@@ av@@ ings .  
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , no one se@@ em@@ s to know what the eff@@ ect will be .  
we have al@@ low@@ ed a sub@@ government ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the country to re@@ mo@@ ve po@@ w@@ er from the house of comm@@ ons .  
that is qu@@ ite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .  
what ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly is go@@ ing on over there ?  
m@@ ad@@ am speaker , i will be very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f .  
that government sim@@ pl@@ y t@@ ell@@ s the people what is go@@ od for them .  
it is the se@@ as@@ on@@ ally ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed fi@@ gu@@ res which sh@@ o@@ w the .@@ 5 p@@ er c@@ ent dro@@ p which are the important fi@@ gu@@ res .  
the ch@@ ai@@ r is re@@ ally emb@@ ar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed by what is tak@@ ing place .  
mr. speaker , i am s@@ or@@ r@@ y , i have not se@@ en the stat@@ ement by a b@@ ri@@ tis@@ h fir@@ m .  
fe@@ w@@ er v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers are av@@ ail@@ able because so many w@@ om@@ en have re@@ tu@@ r@@ n@@ ed to the work for@@ ce .  
they work with them .  
it de@@ pend@@ s on the ex@@ t@@ ent to which they ap@@ pl@@ y th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves .  
i do not know if there is a member in this house who would op@@ pose al@@ lo@@ c@@ ati@@ n@@ g more mon@@ ey for the el@@ der@@ ly .  
they also have a ro@@ le to pl@@ ay in the fo@@ od ch@@ ain .  
this has gi@@ ven a more dem@@ o@@ cr@@ ati@@ c el@@ ement to the th@@ ings we were f@@ ac@@ ed with in our constitu@@ en@@ cy .  
the pro@@ b@@ le@@ m is to ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re the m@@ em@@ or@@ ies of e@@ ver@@ y@@ one who he@@ ard the minister '@@ s st@@ u@@ pi@@ d stat@@ ements of a we@@ e@@ k ag@@ o .  
will the minis@@ try f@@ ill in the r@@ av@@ ine at the end of r@@ un@@ way 2@@ 4@@ l at the pe@@ ar@@ son inter@@ national ai@@ r@@ port at tor@@ on@@ to ?  
if we e@@ ver in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce su@@ ch legislation , i will re@@ min@@ d hi@@ m of his off@@ er .  
my respon@@ se is , so what ?  
this , si@@ r , is what i re@@ comm@@ end to the house .  
wh@@ e@@ ther that will do any go@@ od , i do not know .  
that is the prin@@ cip@@ le which must gu@@ i@@ de the al@@ li@@ ance in the fu@@ ture as we se@@ e@@ k fai@@ r and ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able agre@@ ements with the so@@ vi@@ et uni@@ on .  
i gu@@ ess the sa@@ me k@@ in@@ d of ans@@ w@@ er would have to ap@@ pl@@ y to the mat@@ ter of au@@ t@@ om@@ o@@ bi@@ les .  
they are br@@ ing@@ ing before the house a bill that will res@@ tr@@ ic@@ t those lib@@ er@@ ties .  
for debate , the hon. member for bo@@ w ri@@ ver ( mr. ta@@ y@@ lo@@ r ) .  
mr. speaker , i r@@ ise on a point of order .  
the government ref@@ us@@ es to be@@ lie@@ ve it .  
those were very ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing commit@@ ments , a s@@ or@@ t of pre@@ vi@@ e@@ w of what the very important agricul@@ tu@@ r@@ al sec@@ t@@ or mi@@ ght be@@ come .  
there are tw@@ o re@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing - do@@ or sy@@ n@@ dr@@ om@@ e and g@@ ati@@ n@@ g .  
i h@@ op@@ e he will be b@@ ack with that mo@@ bili@@ z@@ ed public op@@ ini@@ on .  
i think the ar@@ gu@@ ment being made by the government is fau@@ l@@ ty .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , we do have en@@ ough mon@@ ey to b@@ ail out tw@@ o b@@ an@@ ks .  
order .  
it can be st@@ ol@@ en jus@@ t as other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of pro@@ per@@ ty can be st@@ ol@@ en .  
and , se@@ con@@ d , mr. speaker , what we have been do@@ ing s@@ in@@ ce l@@ ast no@@ v@@ emb@@ er is bu@@ il@@ ding up a c@@ li@@ m@@ ate of con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence .  
members should know that cre@@ dit uni@@ ons are a very bi@@ g f@@ ac@@ t@@ or in finan@@ cial ins@@ titu@@ tions in w@@ es@@ ter@@ n canada .  
the member for co@@ ch@@ r@@ an@@ e - su@@ per@@ i@@ or ( mr. pen@@ n@@ er ) said ear@@ li@@ er t@@ on@@ i@@ ght that the on@@ us is on the government to f@@ re@@ e up its members .  
that is my point .  
what of w@@ om@@ en who li@@ ve f@@ ar from c@@ en@@ tres where these services are av@@ ail@@ able ?  
they as@@ k the members of this house to pu@@ t an end to all cu@@ ts in personn@@ el at these sh@@ op@@ s .  
it is not a question of jo@@ in@@ ing ; we are w@@ ell a@@ he@@ ad .  
in an ar@@ tic@@ le w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en by dr@@ . k@@ en@@ ne@@ th h@@ are , re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed in this country as being one of our fo@@ re@@ mo@@ st at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ i@@ c s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st@@ s , the f@@ ol@@ low@@ ing ap@@ pe@@ ars :  
the imp@@ act is per@@ v@@ a@@ si@@ ve .  
in other wor@@ ds , a sub@@ sid@@ y of about $ 2 p@@ er bus@@ h@@ el will come from the re@@ ag@@ an ad@@ minis@@ tr@@ ation to the gr@@ ain f@@ arm@@ ers of the un@@ it@@ ed stat@@ es .  
the fu@@ l@@ l re@@ port will be com@@ ing in before the f@@ all .  
if these r@@ u@@ les were pu@@ t in place , would we in@@ de@@ ed be tre@@ ati@@ n@@ g e@@ ver@@ y@@ one in the sa@@ me way ?  
in them this form@@ er dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ed speaker of the house t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about s@@ ex@@ u@@ al h@@ ar@@ ass@@ ment where some w@@ om@@ en had to dis@@ ro@@ be to qu@@ ali@@ f@@ y for their j@@ ob@@ s .  
i am sim@@ pl@@ y al@@ er@@ ting members to a pro@@ b@@ le@@ m that i se@@ e , gi@@ ven what has been h@@ ap@@ pen@@ ing .  
the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves wh@@ i@@ le in opposition , of cour@@ se , said qu@@ ite the contr@@ ary to what they are do@@ ing now .  
in point of f@@ act , bo@@ th the minister of justice and the so@@ lic@@ it@@ or gen@@ eral have respon@@ ded fu@@ l@@ ly , as b@@ est hu@@ man be@@ ings can .  
does the depu@@ ty prime minister be@@ lie@@ ve that this is the way for a respon@@ si@@ ble government , or an in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent n@@ ation , to make an inter@@ national tre@@ at@@ y ?  
the parliam@@ ent@@ ary sub@@ committee is con@@ sid@@ er@@ ing the wh@@ o@@ le question of e@@ qu@@ ali@@ ty ri@@ gh@@ ts .  
the f@@ act is that no app@@ lic@@ ations inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ing fe@@ w@@ er than f@@ our st@@ u@@ d@@ ent emplo@@ ye@@ es is being sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to any t@@ est of wh@@ e@@ ther or not the j@@ ob@@ s are ca@@ re@@ er or@@ i@@ ent@@ ed .  
we also want a ser@@ ies of ob@@ j@@ ecti@@ ve cr@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a b@@ as@@ ed on f@@ ac@@ t@@ ors su@@ ch as those i am ref@@ er@@ r@@ ing to .  
if we pro@@ ce@@ ed on that b@@ as@@ is in this or in any other direc@@ tion in public li@@ f@@ e , we will al@@ w@@ ays be able to fin@@ d ex@@ c@@ us@@ es .  
th@@ en you br@@ ou@@ ght in y@@ our progr@@ am , the ho@@ te@@ l w@@ ent do@@ wn the tu@@ be and for@@ t st@@ . joh@@ n bec@@ a@@ me a gh@@ o@@ st to@@ wn .  
w@@ ell , in si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s , we did con@@ sul@@ t , we s@@ at do@@ wn with the minister and h@@ am@@ mer@@ ed out an agre@@ ement .  
the right hon. member mi@@ ght dis@@ agre@@ e with h@@ er per@@ sp@@ ecti@@ ve as w@@ ell .  
" l@@ et us try it , " they say , " and se@@ e if it wor@@ ks .  
appro@@ x@@ im@@ at@@ ely $ 3 milli@@ on of this am@@ oun@@ t is al@@ lo@@ c@@ ated from d@@ re@@ e fun@@ ds , with the re@@ main@@ der being commit@@ ted by the de@@ part@@ ment of indi@@ an aff@@ ai@@ rs and nor@@ th@@ er@@ n dev@@ elop@@ ment .  
it can@@ not be st@@ ress@@ ed to@@ o o@@ f@@ t@@ en that canadians are dis@@ tu@@ r@@ b@@ ed by the in@@ cre@@ ase in vi@@ ol@@ ent cri@@ me .  
gr@@ ain ex@@ por@@ ts are pro@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to f@@ all by 2@@ 5 p@@ er c@@ ent in the 19@@ 8@@ 4 - 8@@ 5 cro@@ p year .  
we are so f@@ ar be@@ h@@ in@@ d in this fi@@ el@@ d it m@@ ak@@ es the wh@@ o@@ le country fe@@ el emb@@ ar@@ ass@@ ed .  
they do not re@@ ally chang@@ e the stat@@ us .  
there is no l@@ on@@ g@@ er any dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion to be made on a r@@ ation@@ al b@@ as@@ is bet@@ we@@ en an inter@@ me@@ di@@ ate r@@ ang@@ e and an inter@@ contin@@ ent@@ al r@@ ang@@ e n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar mis@@ si@@ le .  
could i as@@ k the member for w@@ es@@ ter@@ n ar@@ cti@@ c for a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f ans@@ w@@ er , if possi@@ ble .  
gre@@ at@@ er vi@@ c@@ tor@@ i@@ a is a t@@ our@@ is@@ t m@@ ec@@ c@@ a .  
that tax will not be coll@@ ec@@ ted and th@@ en ref@@ un@@ ded .  
there has been a commit@@ ment in the p@@ ast that their parti@@ cip@@ ation r@@ ate would g@@ o at le@@ ast to h@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ c lev@@ els if not tr@@ adi@@ ti@@ onal lev@@ els .  
that is to say , at the re@@ qu@@ est of the per@@ son who m@@ ay be go@@ ing to dec@@ l@@ are his re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cl@@ ai@@ m .  
that is the actu@@ al situation .  
e@@ qu@@ ali@@ z@@ ation pa@@ y@@ ments have be@@ come qu@@ ite con@@ sid@@ er@@ able thr@@ ough the years .  
it has been a mat@@ ter of concer@@ n to re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves of all parti@@ es .  
i would also like to ad@@ v@@ ise the house that there was a de@@ gre@@ e of con@@ sul@@ t@@ ation with resp@@ ect to the p@@ c c@@ au@@ cu@@ s members from man@@ it@@ ob@@ a .  
the part pl@@ a@@ y@@ ed by mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary personn@@ el and their fam@@ ili@@ es in the li@@ f@@ e of the to@@ wn will be l@@ ong re@@ memb@@ er@@ ed in a mo@@ st f@@ av@@ our@@ able li@@ ght .  
with gre@@ at resp@@ ect , i must inter@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t .  
i ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed it th@@ en .  
if the prime minister said that he was w@@ ill@@ ing to re@@ su@@ me ne@@ go@@ ci@@ ations with quebec , why are they in su@@ ch a hu@@ r@@ r@@ y to p@@ as@@ s this bill ?  
in f@@ act , that is why a n@@ um@@ ber of my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues have s@@ po@@ k@@ en out qu@@ ite vi@@ g@@ or@@ ou@@ s@@ ly on the sub@@ j@@ ect .  
i should like to pu@@ t on the re@@ cor@@ d jus@@ t ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what is in the no@@ tes on the finan@@ cial stat@@ ement of mar@@ ch 3@@ 1 , 19@@ 8@@ 4 .  
that ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment is s@@ ent to the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al in question .  
that does not make sen@@ se .  
mr. speaker , many au@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ ties were inv@@ ol@@ ved in ac@@ ting on this em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , what h@@ ap@@ pen@@ ed to the st@@ u@@ di@@ es that were con@@ duc@@ ted af@@ ter that in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent oc@@ cur@@ red ?  
there was a c@@ le@@ ar un@@ der@@ stand@@ ing by the form@@ er minister of trans@@ port that these re@@ gu@@ l@@ ations would not be pr@@ om@@ ul@@ g@@ ated for a year .  
i fe@@ el that is an at@@ titu@@ de in c@@ ab@@ in@@ et which we do not have the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y of al@@ low@@ ing to contin@@ ue .  
in other wor@@ ds , mr. speaker , the government must im@@ pl@@ ement the re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations of the commis@@ si@@ on@@ er of offi@@ cial l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es .  
they will th@@ en re@@ du@@ ce the n@@ um@@ ber of j@@ ob@@ s because what they bu@@ y will be a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation of other op@@ er@@ ations they have .  
it is at the se@@ con@@ d st@@ age of re@@ vi@@ e@@ w that the su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t has r@@ ul@@ ed that a he@@ ar@@ ing is com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y .  
as for la@@ w@@ y@@ ers sp@@ ec@@ i@@ ali@@ z@@ ed in im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation mat@@ ter@@ s , the b@@ ar tak@@ es u@@ p@@ on it@@ sel@@ f to pen@@ ali@@ z@@ e them .  
the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in ter@@ m@@ s of fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n inves@@ t@@ ment is lo@@ an cap@@ it@@ al .  
does he want to w@@ ait un@@ ti@@ l the e@@ conom@@ y of those r@@ ur@@ al a@@ re@@ as is com@@ ple@@ t@@ ely do@@ wn before respon@@ ding to the ac@@ i@@ d r@@ ain pro@@ b@@ le@@ m ?  
i think that should not be to@@ o di@@ ffi@@ cul@@ t to un@@ der@@ st@@ and .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , we must not for@@ get that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of be@@ e@@ f and por@@ k pro@@ duc@@ ers have re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted ou@@ tri@@ ght any me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s for mar@@ ke@@ ting st@@ abili@@ z@@ ation .  
if i had been in br@@ y@@ ce '@@ s position , i would have been right in there with my no@@ se to the public tr@@ ough with the res@@ t of them .  
in other wor@@ ds , we con@@ sid@@ er that the poli@@ tic@@ al ro@@ le and the ad@@ minis@@ tr@@ ative ro@@ le should be ke@@ p@@ t se@@ par@@ ate .  
as a re@@ sul@@ t , the government had to take ste@@ ps to se@@ e that the comp@@ any was tak@@ en over .  
all of these her@@ it@@ age pl@@ ac@@ es are man@@ ag@@ ed by par@@ ks canada for the b@@ en@@ ef@@ it and en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment of all canadians .  
as i in@@ dic@@ ated ear@@ li@@ er in this r@@ ul@@ ing , su@@ ch dis@@ crimin@@ ation was not en@@ vis@@ ag@@ ed in the bill when it was gi@@ ven se@@ con@@ d re@@ ad@@ ing .  
there is a ro@@ le for bo@@ th the public and the priv@@ ate sec@@ t@@ or .  
there will be more cri@@ tic@@ is@@ m , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , because this government , as i un@@ der@@ st@@ and it , is commit@@ ted to m@@ ak@@ ing th@@ ings more op@@ en to the public .  
that is not go@@ od en@@ ough .  
he was the one who t@@ ol@@ d us that the cons@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of a mainten@@ ance c@@ entre for vi@@ a r@@ ail in mon@@ tre@@ al would be in@@ de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely po@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed .  
but th@@ en mr. b@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in said :  
we want fu@@ l@@ l public dis@@ c@@ lo@@ sure of comp@@ any commit@@ ments inv@@ ol@@ ved in take - o@@ ver@@ s of canadian bus@@ in@@ ess .  
there is also a ne@@ ed to c@@ o - ord@@ in@@ ate with provin@@ cial govern@@ ments as to what cert@@ ain a@@ re@@ as re@@ qui@@ re .  
they are of the op@@ ini@@ on that by jus@@ t chang@@ ing the n@@ a@@ me from fir@@ a to inves@@ t@@ ment canada we are go@@ ing to have an au@@ t@@ om@@ ati@@ c in@@ f@@ lo@@ w of dollars .  
can the minister t@@ ell this house what position the canadian government will take in this re@@ g@@ ard ?  
it is n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s s@@ in@@ ce the el@@ ection of this government and we have y@@ et to se@@ e a budget .  
we cur@@ r@@ ent@@ ly al@@ lo@@ w the canadian am@@ at@@ eur a@@ th@@ le@@ ti@@ c as@@ soci@@ ations to be re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed , and it is my be@@ lie@@ f that we should al@@ lo@@ w the provin@@ cial grou@@ ps as w@@ ell to be re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed .  
a canadian am@@ at@@ eur a@@ th@@ le@@ ti@@ c as@@ soci@@ ation by de@@ fin@@ i@@ tion in@@ clu@@ des federal as@@ soci@@ ations but does not in@@ clu@@ de their provin@@ cial coun@@ ter@@ par@@ ts .  
to this b@@ at@@ t@@ le canada g@@ ave 1@@ ,@@ 8@@ 00 g@@ all@@ ant s@@ ail@@ ors and 2@@ 4 pr@@ ou@@ d shi@@ ps .  
i fin@@ d it in@@ cre@@ di@@ ble that the pre@@ sid@@ ent of the tre@@ a@@ sur@@ y bo@@ ard would be l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing about a mat@@ ter as ser@@ i@@ ous as this .  
they have also as@@ k@@ ed for ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal fun@@ ding .  
w@@ ell , e@@ ver@@ y@@ one would agre@@ e with that .  
it is no w@@ on@@ der that there was no per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ i@@ e@@ f ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ ve offi@@ c@@ er for over 1@@ 2 mon@@ th@@ s .  
the minister s@@ po@@ ke of me@@ e@@ tin@@ g@@ s and i ap@@ pl@@ au@@ d that .  
we had to pu@@ t that in st@@ . joh@@ n '@@ s .  
that is an ac@@ cur@@ ate des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of what is h@@ ap@@ pen@@ ing .  
they can@@ not be tre@@ ated in is@@ ol@@ ation .  
he ob@@ vi@@ ou@@ s@@ ly does not like the c@@ o - o@@ p people in e@@ as@@ ter@@ n canada .  
the federal government has a respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ty to be a poli@@ c@@ ing ag@@ ent .  
it w@@ ants to in@@ cre@@ ase the per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of its part - time wor@@ k@@ ers to 4@@ 5 p@@ er c@@ ent of its to@@ t@@ al work for@@ ce .  
in the l@@ ast man@@ it@@ ob@@ a provin@@ cial el@@ ection , 9@@ 00 m@@ ail - in vo@@ tes were re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved and were mo@@ st@@ ly from ur@@ b@@ an vo@@ ter@@ s .  
what does b@@ a@@ si@@ c comm@@ on sen@@ se say ?  
stand@@ ar@@ ds are actu@@ ally str@@ ic@@ ter in ab@@ at@@ to@@ i@@ rs bu@@ il@@ t accor@@ ding to quebec re@@ gu@@ l@@ ations .  
te@@ ch@@ ni@@ ci@@ ans make more than the w@@ r@@ it@@ ers and pl@@ a@@ y@@ w@@ ri@@ gh@@ ts wh@@ ose wor@@ ks are being per@@ form@@ ed .  
they were all le@@ f@@ ti@@ st@@ s .  
it is w@@ ell d@@ one .  
y@@ es , we are a s@@ m@@ all n@@ ation and we are v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able because of our si@@ z@@ e .  
mr. w@@ y@@ man has many years of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in the finan@@ cial mar@@ k@@ et sec@@ t@@ or .  
l@@ et '@@ s think about that for jus@@ t a m@@ om@@ ent .  
i do not think we should be@@ at ar@@ oun@@ d the bus@@ h any l@@ on@@ g@@ er about how to s@@ et th@@ ings right .  
it sa@@ ys that res@@ our@@ ce imp@@ act fun@@ ding h@@ el@@ ps indi@@ an people to get a pi@@ e@@ ce of the ac@@ tion .  
one of the ma@@ j@@ or ob@@ j@@ ecti@@ ves of these con@@ sul@@ t@@ ations is to make sure that the re@@ co@@ very b@@ en@@ ef@@ its all .  
mr. speaker , i think that in his spe@@ ec@@ h , the hon. member from b@@ ai@@ e - com@@ eau mis@@ re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed re@@ ali@@ ty .  
it is a mat@@ ter of el@@ ement@@ ary justice that w@@ om@@ en '@@ s j@@ ob@@ s be fai@@ r@@ ly e@@ val@@ u@@ ated .  
we in@@ ten@@ d to contin@@ ue this dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion with the b@@ en@@ ef@@ it of the vi@@ e@@ w@@ s of a wi@@ de r@@ ang@@ e of inter@@ es@@ ted parti@@ es .  
i think parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly of s@@ ing@@ le par@@ ents .  
the minister of re@@ gi@@ onal e@@ conom@@ i@@ c exp@@ an@@ sion tre@@ ats all mat@@ ter@@ s rel@@ ated to quebec with a gre@@ at de@@ al of fai@@ r@@ n@@ ess and hon@@ es@@ ty .  
as a mat@@ ter of f@@ act that n@@ et f@@ ar@@ m in@@ come re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed its low@@ est lev@@ el s@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 7@@ 0 and the th@@ ir@@ d low@@ est lev@@ el s@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 3@@ 8 , some 4@@ 5 years ag@@ o .  
in the l@@ av@@ al - deux - mon@@ t@@ ag@@ nes a@@ re@@ a , $ 2@@ 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 was sp@@ ent in 19@@ 8@@ 4 but only $ 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 will be sp@@ ent this year mr. speaker .  
this parti@@ cul@@ ar minister made pers@@ onal el@@ ection pr@@ om@@ ises that he would not only con@@ sul@@ t with fis@@ her@@ m@@ en but that he would be re@@ adi@@ ly av@@ ail@@ able when probl@@ em@@ s ar@@ ise .  
that inves@@ t@@ ment is being ne@@ g@@ l@@ ec@@ ted , pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y in b@@ ri@@ tis@@ h col@@ um@@ bi@@ a .  
the ou@@ t@@ stand@@ ing issue has been the f@@ ail@@ ure to make a fun@@ ding commit@@ ment for the er@@ d@@ a agre@@ ement .  
he should come c@@ le@@ an on this issue this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in@@ ste@@ ad of gi@@ v@@ ing us all this go@@ b@@ b@@ le@@ dy - go@@ o@@ k .  
he said that b@@ ri@@ tis@@ h t@@ el@@ ec@@ o@@ m « has not dem@@ on@@ str@@ ated its mar@@ ke@@ ting s@@ av@@ v@@ y or pro@@ duc@@ t man@@ ag@@ ement abili@@ ty » .  
fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n inves@@ t@@ ment was r@@ un@@ n@@ ing canada as th@@ ough it were the fi@@ f@@ ty - first st@@ ate .  
it does not con@@ duc@@ t res@@ ear@@ ch and dev@@ elop@@ ment .  
the first question is : why does agricul@@ ture re@@ qui@@ re st@@ abili@@ z@@ ation ?  
as a gen@@ eral r@@ u@@ le , all the pro@@ duc@@ ers of any gi@@ ven com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity are aff@@ ec@@ ted sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ou@@ s@@ ly by a co@@ st - pri@@ ce s@@ que@@ e@@ z@@ e .  
we have a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ri@@ ding .  
so the re@@ al pro@@ b@@ le@@ m is that f@@ arm@@ ers are le@@ av@@ ing f@@ arm@@ ing .  
l@@ et us g@@ o to the question of what the public se@@ em@@ s to be sa@@ ying on this issue of sen@@ ate re@@ form .  
as this is what is re@@ qui@@ red , it is the t@@ ar@@ get the government has in min@@ d .  
that , i be@@ lie@@ ve , we all fin@@ d un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table , re@@ gar@@ d@@ l@@ ess of poli@@ tic@@ al party .  
l@@ et me re@@ tu@@ r@@ n to the bill which is before us .  
it is a mis@@ take to do what the tor@@ ies are propos@@ ing to do to diff@@ er@@ enti@@ ate their bill .  
we know how pa@@ in@@ fu@@ l that can be for people who are go@@ ing thr@@ ough a per@@ i@@ od of their li@@ f@@ e which is not parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly jo@@ y@@ fu@@ l .  
the es@@ t@@ ab@@ lis@@ h@@ ment of su@@ ch a system should th@@ er@@ e@@ fore be a pri@@ or@@ ity in e@@ ac@@ h provin@@ ce where it does not al@@ re@@ ad@@ y ex@@ is@@ t .  
we have been col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues for a l@@ ong time .  
it will h@@ el@@ p canadian comp@@ an@@ ies to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate their re@@ tu@@ r@@ n to a he@@ al@@ th@@ y finan@@ cial position by at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting new e@@ qu@@ ity inves@@ t@@ ment .  
the uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al fam@@ il@@ y al@@ low@@ ance is main@@ t@@ ain@@ ed .  
res@@ ear@@ ch is a lo@@ w pri@@ or@@ ity .  
o@@ h ?  
there are in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed co@@ st@@ s for sh@@ am@@ po@@ o and dr@@ in@@ ks for k@@ i@@ ds , p@@ et fo@@ od , g@@ as , and e@@ ven he@@ ati@@ n@@ g the hom@@ e .  
this te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que is not un@@ u@@ su@@ al on the b@@ as@@ is of pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ents .  
sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , un@@ der the l@@ ast lib@@ eral budget , pers@@ onal in@@ come in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed in 19@@ 8@@ 4 by 7 p@@ er c@@ ent .  
but the government tre@@ ats it@@ sel@@ f to l@@ av@@ is@@ h sp@@ end@@ ing and eng@@ ag@@ es in b@@ ail@@ ing out cor@@ por@@ ations .  
there will be im@@ prov@@ ed sur@@ vi@@ v@@ or b@@ en@@ ef@@ it re@@ gu@@ l@@ ations for w@@ om@@ en , stand@@ ar@@ ds for pen@@ sion b@@ en@@ ef@@ it sp@@ li@@ t@@ ting on mar@@ ri@@ age b@@ re@@ ak@@ do@@ wn , and e@@ qu@@ ali@@ ty stand@@ ar@@ ds .  
in f@@ act , if one ad@@ ds in some other th@@ ings re@@ sul@@ ting from the w@@ es@@ ter@@ n accord , i think it is more li@@ k@@ ely to be 2@@ .@@ 8 c@@ ents p@@ er li@@ tre .  
we f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w thr@@ ough with our el@@ ection ple@@ d@@ g@@ es .  
we must re@@ vi@@ ve our e@@ conom@@ y , cre@@ ate j@@ ob@@ s , r@@ ation@@ ali@@ z@@ e government sp@@ end@@ ing , ad@@ minister with in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy .  
it does not make a lo@@ t of sen@@ se , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly when you lo@@ o@@ k at who is pa@@ ying .  
what will they do with that cap@@ it@@ al ?  
that is r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly e@@ qu@@ al to the $ 4@@ 4@@ 0 milli@@ on p@@ aid to can@@ ad@@ ai@@ r in tw@@ o years .  
from these he@@ ar@@ ings , it bec@@ a@@ me ob@@ vi@@ ous that the ma@@ j@@ or concer@@ n was cap@@ it@@ al g@@ ain@@ s .  
it in@@ dic@@ at@@ es to indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al canadians that for to@@ o l@@ ong government has made their dec@@ isi@@ ons for them .  
that br@@ ings to min@@ d the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of y@@ oun@@ g canadians i m@@ et rec@@ ent@@ ly , mo@@ st of them qu@@ ite dis@@ ill@@ u@@ si@@ on@@ ed .  
this is why i can@@ not fin@@ d m@@ y@@ sel@@ f sup@@ por@@ ti@@ ve of the re@@ qu@@ est for ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal fun@@ ding for the government by way of b@@ or@@ ro@@ w@@ ing .  
the hon. member sa@@ ys : « ne@@ g@@ l@@ ec@@ ted quebec » , and i agre@@ e .  
i was g@@ l@@ ad to he@@ ar that cro@@ wn cor@@ por@@ ations with a comm@@ er@@ cial val@@ ue but no on@@ go@@ ing public poli@@ cy pu@@ r@@ pose will be sol@@ d .  
we have tak@@ en these con@@ sid@@ er@@ ations very m@@ u@@ ch into ac@@ coun@@ t when we des@@ ign@@ ed the budget .  
will the prime minister li@@ ve up to that commit@@ ment ?  
can the minister cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y the eff@@ ect of the re@@ duc@@ tion ?  
th@@ us f@@ ar , i have been des@@ cri@@ b@@ ing the p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of my constitu@@ en@@ cy .  
we be@@ lie@@ ve they will ac@@ cep@@ t the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .  
can he t@@ ell them that is fai@@ r ?  
it has been years and years s@@ in@@ ce our bus@@ in@@ ess commun@@ ity go@@ t su@@ ch a vote of con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence from government .  
the pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve con@@ serv@@ ative party of canada is provi@@ ding the opposition .  
they st@@ o@@ od to a per@@ son and ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ded l@@ ou@@ d@@ ly .  
e@@ i@@ ght .  
no , mr. speaker , not qu@@ ite .  
i would like now to g@@ o into the the@@ or@@ y be@@ h@@ in@@ d the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of cap@@ it@@ al g@@ ain@@ s tax .  
it will in@@ cre@@ ase po@@ ver@@ ty in the mo@@ st v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able people , sen@@ i@@ or ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , who will not be able to g@@ o out and fin@@ d other s@@ ources of in@@ come .  
c@@ f@@ b mo@@ ose j@@ a@@ w is also the hom@@ e of the s@@ no@@ w@@ bi@@ r@@ ds , canada '@@ s a@@ er@@ ob@@ ati@@ c ai@@ r te@@ am .  
our c@@ au@@ cu@@ s he@@ ard the other day from the at@@ l@@ anti@@ c provinces e@@ conom@@ i@@ c coun@@ ci@@ l .

that is one ma@@ j@@ or pro@@ b@@ le@@ m .  
i w@@ is@@ h to direc@@ t the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of my comm@@ ents today to the many im@@ prov@@ ements off@@ er@@ ed in the pen@@ sion program@@ s av@@ ail@@ able to all canadians .  
fu@@ r@@ th@@ er@@ more , the er@@ o@@ sion of the co@@ st b@@ ase of as@@ se@@ ts by in@@ f@@ l@@ ation was also re@@ gar@@ ded as som@@ e@@ thing that should be com@@ pen@@ s@@ ated for .  
the budget is re@@ alis@@ ti@@ c because it tak@@ es a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and sen@@ si@@ ble appro@@ ac@@ h .  
that is not the inter@@ est or concer@@ n of this government .  
they vo@@ ted for a chang@@ e in the national aff@@ ai@@ rs of our n@@ ation .  
on a point of order , mr. speaker .  
the f@@ ac@@ ts are c@@ le@@ ar .  
the motion of the hon. member for be@@ a@@ ch@@ es th@@ er@@ e@@ fore gi@@ ves us an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to do in this house what e@@ ver@@ y@@ one el@@ se is now do@@ ing thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the country .  
they also have a te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ al lib@@ r@@ ary , and the comp@@ any sp@@ end@@ s ne@@ ar@@ ly $ 2 milli@@ on ann@@ u@@ ally on these res@@ ear@@ ch services .

not only are the ris@@ ks gre@@ at@@ er but the time re@@ qui@@ red to pre@@ par@@ e for mar@@ ine re - sup@@ pl@@ y is l@@ eng@@ th@@ y .

fu@@ r@@ th@@ er@@ more , there is the prov@@ ision in our res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of h@@ av@@ ing had to ser@@ ve for a per@@ i@@ od in ex@@ c@@ ess of 3@@ 6@@ 5 d@@ ays in canada as the b@@ as@@ is of e@@ li@@ gi@@ bili@@ ty .  
the government said that it had not had time to t@@ al@@ k to e@@ i@@ ther grou@@ p about that propos@@ al .  
in other wor@@ ds , the w@@ ri@@ ting is on the w@@ all .  
they were sa@@ ying that hom@@ e@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ers would lo@@ se ag@@ ain because inter@@ est r@@ at@@ es were ris@@ ing .  
our inter@@ national ro@@ le has som@@ e@@ how coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .  
for in@@ st@@ ance , if we lo@@ o@@ k at cro@@ p in@@ sur@@ ance , the federal government has pu@@ t up h@@ al@@ f the premi@@ um@@ s and the pro@@ duc@@ ers have pu@@ t up the other h@@ al@@ f .  
so we can@@ not think in those ter@@ m@@ s .  
the minister has said that the only pro@@ b@@ le@@ m with can@@ d@@ u and the wh@@ o@@ le n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar po@@ w@@ er op@@ tion is a mar@@ ke@@ ting one .  
why was it that i was re@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ing those k@@ in@@ d of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations ?  
» that is what the pres@@ ent prime minister t@@ ol@@ d the form@@ er prime minister .  
mo@@ st of them are un@@ able to work .  
a fe@@ w d@@ ays ag@@ o my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue from es@@ se@@ x - w@@ ind@@ s@@ or g@@ ave the house a h@@ is@@ tor@@ y l@@ es@@ son .  
the ar@@ tic@@ le re@@ ad@@ s :  
he said that he was bu@@ r@@ n@@ ing o@@ il .  
the government has y@@ et to come to the point of de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing how and when this chang@@ e should take place .  
i ref@@ er@@ red ear@@ li@@ er to the b@@ et tak@@ en up by the prime minister ( mr. m@@ ul@@ r@@ on@@ ey ) concern@@ ing employ@@ ment as rel@@ ated to im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , we se@@ e in the legislation before us today only tw@@ o sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ve amend@@ ments and a n@@ um@@ ber of hou@@ se@@ ke@@ e@@ p@@ ing amend@@ ments to the bill .  
we as a soci@@ e@@ ty can@@ not af@@ for@@ d to dis@@ crimin@@ ate am@@ ong indi@@ vi@@ du@@ als on that s@@ or@@ t of b@@ as@@ is .  
this t@@ y@@ pe of federal - provin@@ cial c@@ o - op@@ er@@ ation is re@@ qui@@ red to in@@ cre@@ ase the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ v@@ ity and e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy of our cur@@ r@@ ent dis@@ e@@ ase sur@@ v@@ e@@ ill@@ ance syst@@ em@@ s .  
he su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ted that j@@ une at le@@ ast would be a bet@@ ter time .  
in 19@@ 3@@ 4 , the comp@@ any was ren@@ am@@ ed the nor@@ th@@ er@@ n trans@@ port@@ ation comp@@ any li@@ m@@ it@@ ed , s@@ ti@@ l@@ l un@@ der priv@@ ate o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p .  
i do comm@@ end the minister of trans@@ port for f@@ ol@@ low@@ ing thr@@ ough on the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ter@@ m@@ s of ref@@ er@@ ence .  
th@@ en and only th@@ en does the priv@@ ate sec@@ t@@ or r@@ us@@ h in sa@@ ying that it can@@ not have all these publi@@ c@@ ly - o@@ w@@ n@@ ed cor@@ por@@ ations inter@@ fer@@ ing in the priv@@ ate sec@@ t@@ or .  
sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ ty services su@@ ch as st@@ and - by sup@@ pl@@ y v@@ ess@@ els for the beau@@ for@@ t se@@ a o@@ il and g@@ as indus@@ try can be provi@@ ded by o@@ th@@ ers .  
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely or for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , ho@@ we@@ ver one vi@@ e@@ w@@ s the issue , that parti@@ cul@@ ar minister has not m@@ et with very m@@ u@@ ch su@@ c@@ c@@ ess .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the ch@@ ai@@ r could dis@@ pose of motion no. 1 .  
on the w@@ est co@@ ast we have the minister '@@ s ad@@ vis@@ or@@ y committee which , wh@@ i@@ le not per@@ f@@ ect , is at le@@ ast of ass@@ is@@ t@@ ance .  
this is a fin@@ e exam@@ p@@ le of a part@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p in pro@@ g@@ res@@ s bet@@ we@@ en government and indus@@ try .  
mr. speaker , my question is direc@@ ted to the minister of trans@@ port .  
mr. speaker , l@@ et me be c@@ le@@ ar .  
with@@ in the government of canada , a n@@ um@@ ber of de@@ part@@ ments have been acti@@ v@@ ely inv@@ ol@@ ved and have been pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ding in a c@@ o - op@@ er@@ ative and co@@ ord@@ in@@ ated f@@ as@@ hi@@ on .  
ho@@ we@@ ver , the contr@@ adi@@ c@@ tion bet@@ we@@ en what he said and what has been said by his offi@@ ci@@ als re@@ qui@@ res fu@@ r@@ ther in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent inves@@ ti@@ g@@ ation .  
i know that we are tr@@ ying to do it , at the federal lev@@ el thr@@ ough the f@@ ar@@ m cre@@ dit cor@@ por@@ ation .  
these are k@@ ey e@@ conom@@ i@@ c in@@ dic@@ at@@ ors .  
pro@@ duc@@ tion is being exp@@ and@@ ed with the dev@@ elop@@ ment of a si@@ x@@ th f@@ ar@@ m at bo@@ w@@ d@@ en ins@@ titu@@ tion in al@@ ber@@ t@@ a .  
that was the prin@@ cip@@ le of the bill as pass@@ ed on se@@ con@@ d re@@ ad@@ ing .  
su@@ re@@ ly no one , and parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly no member of the con@@ serv@@ ative party , would be@@ lie@@ ve that .  
the people of canada did that on se@@ p@@ t@@ emb@@ er 4 .  
c@@ all in the members .  
we think that now is the time for the re@@ gu@@ l@@ ations and pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res to be pro@@ per@@ ly es@@ t@@ ab@@ lis@@ h@@ ed .  
the point was w@@ ell tak@@ en because the su@@ c@@ c@@ ess of these agre@@ ements will de@@ pen@@ d to a con@@ sid@@ er@@ able de@@ gre@@ e u@@ p@@ on the qu@@ ali@@ ty of their ad@@ minis@@ tr@@ ation .  
canada can be pr@@ ou@@ d of its re@@ cor@@ d on hu@@ man ri@@ gh@@ ts and should ser@@ ve as an exam@@ p@@ le of t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance to other coun@@ tri@@ es .  
wh@@ ose ad@@ vi@@ ce did he f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w in m@@ ak@@ ing his dec@@ ision , in that his offi@@ ci@@ als re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted it ?  
mr. speaker , i am ple@@ as@@ ed that the prime minister has provi@@ ded the inform@@ ation in the house .  
m@@ ay i th@@ er@@ e@@ fore as@@ k the hon. member to re@@ fr@@ ain from any fu@@ r@@ ther dis@@ pl@@ ays .  
why did the prime minister ap@@ pe@@ ar pre@@ pa@@ red to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard his pr@@ om@@ ise in the first place ?  
mr. speaker , i am al@@ w@@ ays am@@ us@@ ed by these pro@@ b@@ ing questions from the lib@@ eral party , the party which sa@@ ys that it would con@@ tro@@ l the de@@ fic@@ it .  
su@@ re@@ ly the hon. member is not su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ting that we lev@@ y tax@@ es on comp@@ an@@ ies that have been lo@@ s@@ ing mon@@ ey .  
mr. speaker , the pre@@ m@@ ise of the question pu@@ t by the hon. member is w@@ r@@ ong .  
how many people are employ@@ ed ( a ) direc@@ t@@ ly or by contr@@ act ( b ) fu@@ l@@ l time and part time , in the offi@@ ce of the prime minister ?  
the fe@@ es p@@ aid to e@@ ac@@ h per@@ form@@ er were in ke@@ e@@ p@@ ing with the ro@@ le pl@@ a@@ y@@ ed in the g@@ a@@ la and with the stand@@ ar@@ ds of the uni@@ on des ar@@ ti@@ st@@ es .  
du@@ r@@ ing the lib@@ eral ad@@ minis@@ tr@@ ation no@@ thing was d@@ one about it .  
they know about the o@@ ver@@ pro@@ duc@@ tion pro@@ b@@ le@@ m .
